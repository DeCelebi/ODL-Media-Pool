## File structure and naming conventions

We could have used branches for L10n, but as this is (primarily) targeted towards nontechnical users, we opted for the old-fashioned naming conventions. 

It's dead simple:

- Every logical entity of content has its own subfolder in the appropriate parent directory, which is to be named in English.

- Every file that is or should become available in localized versions is to be prefixed with at least a two-digit country (language, region, script) code - we use the [IETF language tag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) - and to be named in that respective language. 

**Examples:** 

en-US_color.md<br />
en-GB_colour.md<br />
fr-couleur.md<br />
it-tinta.md<br />
pl-farba.md<br />
de_Farbe.md<br />

## Notes on file size

Feel free to add your retina images, but keep videos small. Add well compressed videos of low weight (a few megs) and include a reference where to find a HD version of it - or even better, only include the reference. :)
