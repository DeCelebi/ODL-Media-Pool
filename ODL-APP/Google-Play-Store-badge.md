Here I'll show you how to add the Google PlayStore badge to your ODL Website. 

First of all, here is the link to the App: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelart.odl">click here</a>

It's really easy:
1. Go to http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/promote/badges.html
2. Select your language
3. Type in the Package field 'com.pixelart.odl' (without the " ' ")
4. Select the badge type and click on "Build my badge"
5. Just copy & paste the generated code to your Website
6. Enjoy!
